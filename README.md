# Approach
Regardless of the enormous technological advancements and industrialization, approximately 70 percent  of  the  Indian  population  is  connected  with  agriculture  and  its  related  activities.  It contributes  about  15.78%  to  the  Indian  economy.  One  of  the  most  important  agricultural processes that is adapted for better growth of the plants is irrigation. Due to changing climate and degraded quality of soil, farmers are getting less production in farms. Due to these problems, Farmers face serious long-term consequences. “Prevention is better than cure”. The best way to overcome such trails is to solve the problem before it actually happens. For that We have proposed the concept of SMART FARMING through our Project which detects upcoming issues so that farmers can take immediate actions and stop it. Our proposed project alerts farmers regarding such upcoming problems. Currently, cultivation consumes around 70 percent of the freshwater. This percentage should be decreased by performing efficient water management systems. 

Our project predicts how much water reserve will be required by farmers for their crop during no irrigation season in order to reduce water scarcity. Water reservation problem will be solved. Those Farmers who live in areas where they have to buy tankers of water, precise water requirement prediction will save their money. 

Our Project answers whether the soil is too much acidic or alkaline which helps farmers to eliminate the risk of losing yields. Farmers will be aware of their soil nature due to which they will have better prediction about which crop has to be grown. Through this, they will have an Increase in Production, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our Project analyses measurements taken on ground level which introduce the concept of Accurate Farming and proper field evaluation that can answer farmers how to handle microbiological processes of soil microorganisms and how to stop the growth of mold and bacteria that cause plants to die and crops to fail.

Our animal detection system and Radar System will prevent animals or flying beings to enter into crops. Our project Alerts Farmers when there is high soil temperature so that farmers can take immediate steps such as water sprinkling, etc to prevent roots from being damaged. Weather Forecasting alert though SMS helps farmers to take important decisions like harvesting, sowing, etc. precisely. Our project is also monitoring farms through unique Geo-mapping and tagging program known as Google Earth. The key to Google Earth is that it presents a “base layer” of an aerial photographic image that is geo-located. There are layers of information available for the farm, including soil map3mineral deposits and other information about any location. You can know your problem areas on the farm with map layers that you can add to Google Earth.  This can be valuable information for managing the whole farm.

Our project provides all solutions to daily problems of Indian farmers. Further Overall Operation cost will be reduced and production quality and quantity will be increased and there will be reduced environmental footprint. Our country is dependent on the farmers as they provide us one of the most essential needs to survive i.e., food. We hope, through our small contribution we can put a smile on the face of millions of farmers and improve our Country's Agricultural economy.



# SENSORS AND MICROCONTROLLER
We  have  a  wide  variety  of  choices  for  microcontrollers  and  sensors.  For  this  basic implementation Arduino mega will be best fit, because the Arduino MEGA 2560 is designed for projects that require more I/O lines, more sketch memory and more RAM. With 54 digital I/O pins, 16 analog inputs and a larger space for your sketch it is the recommended board for 3D printers and robotics projects. We can accumulate various sensors with our controller which includes –

• Soil Moisture Sensor - Monitoring soil moisture will help farmers understand the actual soil water condition and how much their crops need to use. Soil moisture sensors enable in taking informed irrigation decisions on when to irrigate and how much water has to be supplied to avoid low quality production.
• Soil PH Sensor - When trying to grow a lot of food in a small space, every little bit counts. [10] And if there’s one thing that will keep your soil productive for many years to come, it’s monitoring your soil PH. Most of Indian Farmers are unaware of concept of acidity or alkalinity of soil. Reasons to pay attention to soil PH:
• Soil pH Affects Nutrient Uptake 
• Soil pH Affects Microbial Activity 
• Soil pH May Affect Certain Diseases 
• Soil pH Affects Crop Yield
• Humidity  Sensor - A humidity sensor is  an  electronic  device  that  measures the humidity in its environment and converts its findings into a corresponding electrical signal. Relative humidity is calculated by comparing the live humidity reading at a given temperature to the maximum amount of humidity for air at the same temperature.
• Passive Infrared Sensor - A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors. [8] PIR sensors detect general movement, but do not give information on who or what moved. A PIR-based motion detector is used to sense movement of people, animals, or other objects.
• Temperature Sensor - A temperature sensor is an electronic device that measures the temperature of its environment and converts the input data into electronic data to record, monitor, or signal temperature changes.
• Light Sensor - The sensors work by actively measuring the various wavelengths of light coming off of crop leaves. [8] These measurements are then used by an optical transducer to calculate how much nitrogen crops need for optimal health.

# LANGUAGES & FRAMEWORKS
This project involves a variety of software frameworks for its working from a large number of frameworks available. The languages and frameworks used in this project are as follows:
•        For App Development: Frameworks:
1.   Android Studio: Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development, based on IntelliJ IDEA. On top of IntelliJ's powerful code editor and developer tools, Android Studio offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android app.

3.   GCP: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google (company), is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube.
Languages:
Java:
Java is a language which is used at a major scale for the development of 
mobile applications. Some of the other languages are there which can be used to develop the Android application like C and C++ using Native Development Kit (NDK), but Java is recommended to develop the applications. In available IDE i.e., Android Studio, Java is default language to code whereas C and C++ are in options. It supports native code also, so C and C++ are applicable to code for the mobile application.

While it is not required to use a web framework, it is extremely  recommended  because  it  helps  you  develop  complex  applications  in significantly less time.

Then, we moved to the next stage of our project i.e., ML dataset & training. We have to find the dataset relevant for our project that can be used to get the future predictions about the crop we should grow in the next season to get maximum yield. We have researched over many sources and finded out the relevant dataset that can be used in our project to get the prediction. Next step of our project is to train this dataset to get the maximum possible accuracy. We have a lot of number of algorithms available which can be used to train the datasets. We have used many popular datasets and finded out their accuracy in each case. We find out that we are getting maximum accuracy in our dataset using Random Forest Algorithm. We have finalized 
9embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from 
our ML algorithm and trained the dataset using Random Forest.
The next step in the development phase is to develop a website which shows and demonstrates the idea and working of project. We developed a website using latest technologies - Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. to make it fully advanced and user-friendly.
